# 🛡️ Python Keylogger (Educational Use Only)

This project implements a basic **keylogger** in Python using the [`pynput`](https://pynput.readthedocs.io/) library. 
It captures and records keystrokes to a local file for learning and ethical monitoring purposes.

- Saves logs to a customizable file (`keylogs.txt` by default)
- Simple and beginner-friendly Python structure
- Real-time key capture using `pynput.keyboard.Listener`
